            <p>Heeellloooooooo lovely peoples. <br>  I'm back! You see, I had an idea. I never finish my games. Ever. So, what have I decided to do you ask? Work on a game, for every day of the month that I can. 
            <p>Rules:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Godot.</li>
            	<li>I must spend at least 30 minutes each day.</li>
            	<li>If I skip a day for a reason that is in my control, I have to work the amount of time I'd spend on the game that day, the next day. This piles up.</li>
            	<li>The game is developed in January (including art & music), bugs fixed in February. Release on the 28th.</li>
           </ul>
           <p>So... the idea?</p>
           <p> Deliver packages.</p>
